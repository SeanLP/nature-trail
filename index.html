            <p>
                Hiking improves fitness, builds muscle and strengthens bones. It has been shown that walking on uneven
                terrain can increase the amount of energy used by up to 28% compared to walking on flat terrain. Hiking
                improves blood flow and oxygen to the brain which enhances several areas of the brain. These include the
                areas responsible for concentration, focus, memory and happiness. Some research has shown that spending
                time outdoors increases attention spans and creative problem-solving skills by as much as 50%.

            <p>
                Hiking is a fairly accessible sport for everyone so not only will you get to know more people, you’ll
                get to know people you might never have crossed paths with within your usual social circles. With so
                many external sources demanding our attention, sometimes we forget to stop and reflect. Hiking is
                perfect for this. A lot of the most beautiful places for hiking don’t have mobile phone reception and
                the combination of fresh air and fabulous views, as well as physical activity, give your mind a chance
                to wander.
